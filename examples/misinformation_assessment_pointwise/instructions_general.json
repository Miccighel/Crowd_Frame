		"text": "<p>First, you will be asked to fill in four questionnaires that will help us collect more reliable data.</p><p>You will then be asked to rate 8 statements, each of them expressed by a person in a given context. You will be shown the 8 statements, one at a time. Each statement is not altered in any way and it is reported as in the original source. For each statement, your task is <strong>to judge the truthfulness and validity of the statement</strong> using the radio buttons. If you wish to change a previously given judgment, you can use the back button to revisit it.</p><p> For each judgment, you will also be asked to <strong>provide a URL and a short text to justify your selection</strong> by using our search engine. You will have to choose one of the URLs provided as result to your search queries by such search engine. Finally, you will have to <strong>fill a textarea with your justification</strong>.</p> <p>The statements are not presented in any particular order. You might see many good statements, many bad ones, or any combination. Try not to anticipate, and simply rate each statement after reading it. Don't try to guess or randomly click, as there are some cross-checks, as indicated above. Note that youâ€™ll need to answer <strong>all questions and fill in every field</strong>, otherwise you will not be able to proceed to the following steps.</p>"
