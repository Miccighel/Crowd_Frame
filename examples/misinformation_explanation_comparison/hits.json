        "gold_evidence": "Increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and ozone have correspondingly strengthened their absorption and emission of infrared radiation, causing the rise in average global temperature since the mid-20th century. Not only do increasing carbon dioxide concentrations lead to increases in global surface temperature, but increasing global temperatures also cause increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide. Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to an increase in dissolved CO2, which causes ocean acidification. Indirectly, human activity that increases global temperatures will increase water vapor concentrations, a process known as water vapor feedback.",
