		"text": "<p><font face=\"Arial\">In this task, you will be asked to select a value to indicate the <strong>truthfulness level</strong> of four claims dealing with climate change. For each claim, we ask you to tell us its truthfulness level; that is,<strong>how much the claim represents the reality</strong>; how reliable it is.</font></p><p><font face=\"Arial\"> We will show you the text of the claim along with three explanation sentences generated by automatic models that should help you to select the most appropriate truthfulness label for each of the four claims. Note that the explanations are automatically generated, thus it might be incorrect or contradict each other. Furthermore, note that the generated explanations might refer to the evidence that the models had retrieved, which might be incorrect as well.Thus, to assess the final truthfulness score you should retrieve some evidence (for example by querying google) and validate the explanation.</font></p><p><font face=\"Arial\">The truth level for the statement must be selected among 2 different labels: If the claim totally represents reality you should select <strong>True</strong>, while if it is false you should select <strong>False</strong>. Then, you are also required to rate the explanations as well as to explain the rationale behind your choices; that is, why you preferred one explanation over the others.</font></p><p><font face=\"Arial\">Note that there are some checks throughout the task, and if you do not perform these correctly you will not be able to terminate and get paid. The data from this task is being gathered for research purposes. No personally-identifying information is recorded. Participation is entirely voluntary, and you are free to discontinue at any point.</font></p>"
